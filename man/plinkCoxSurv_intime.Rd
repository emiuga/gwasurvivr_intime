\title{Fit time interval Cox survival to all variants from PLINK binary files (.BED, .BIM, .FAM)}
\usage{
plinkCoxSurv.intime(bed.file, covariate.file, id.column, sample.ids = NULL,
  time.start, time.stop, event, covariates, inter.term = NULL,
  print.covs = "only", out.file, chunk.size = 10000,
  maf.filter = 0.005, flip.dosage = TRUE, verbose = TRUE,
  clusterObj = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{bed.file}{character of name of plink files without extension}

\item{covariate.file}{data.frame comprising phenotype information, all 
covariates to be added in the model must be numeric.}

\item{id.column}{character giving the name of the ID column
in covariate.file.}

\item{sample.ids}{character vector of sample IDs to keep in
survival analysis}

\item{time.start}{character of column name in covariate.file that
represents the start time of interest in the analysis}

\item{time.stop}{character of column name in covariate.file that
represents the stop time of interest in the analysis}

\item{event}{character of column name in covariate.file that represents
the event of interest to be included in the analysis}

\item{covariates}{character vector with exact names of columns in
covariate.file to include in analysis}

\item{inter.term}{character string giving the column name of the covariate
that will be added to the interaction term with
SNP (e.g. \code{term*SNP}). See details.}

\item{print.covs}{character string of either \code{"only"}, \code{"all"}
or \code{"some"}, defining which covariate statistics should be printed to
the output. See details.}

\item{out.file}{character of output file name (do not include extension)}

\item{chunk.size}{integer number of variants to process per thread}

\item{maf.filter}{numeric to filter minor allele frequency
 (i.e. choosing 0.05 means filtering MAF>0.05). User can set this to 
\code{NULL} if no filtering is preffered. Default is 0.05.}

\item{flip.dosage}{logical to flip which allele the dosage was
calculated on, default \code{flip.dosage=TRUE}}

\item{verbose}{logical for messages that describe which part of the
analysis is currently being run}

\item{clusterObj}{A cluster object that can be used with the
\code{parApply} function. See details.}
}
\value{
Saves two text files directly to disk:  
\code{.coxph} extension containing CoxPH survival analysis results.  
\code{.snps_removed} extension containing SNPs that were removed
 due to low variance or user-defined thresholds.
}
\description{
Performs survival analysis using Cox proportional hazard models on directly 
typed data in PLINK format
}
\details{
Testing for SNP-covariate interactions:          
User can define the column name of the covariate that will be included in
 the interaction term. 
For example, for given covariates \code{a} and \code{b}, where \code{c} is
 defined as the \code{inter.term} the model will be:
 \code{~ a + b + c + SNP + c*SNP}.

Printing results of other covariates:       
\code{print.covs} argument controls the number of covariates will be printed
 as output. The function is set to \code{only}
 by default and will only print the SNP or if an interaction term is given, 
 the results of the interaction 
 term (e.g. \code{SNP*covariate}). Whereas,  \code{all} will print results
 (coef, se.coef, p.value etc) of all covariates included in the model.
 \code{some} is only applicable if an interaction term is given and will 
 print the results for SNP, covariate tested for interaction and the
 interaction term. User should be mindful about using the \code{all} option,
 as it will likely slow down the analysis and will increase
 the output file size. 

User defined parallelization:  
This function uses \code{parApply} from \code{parallel} package to fit 
 models to SNPs in parallel. 
User is not required to set any options for the parallelization. 
However, advanced users who wish to optimize it, can provide a 
 cluster object generated by \code{makeCluster} family of functions that 
 suits their need and platform.
